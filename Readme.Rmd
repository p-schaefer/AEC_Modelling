## Objective

The goal of this project is to use data from [Ontario's Aquatic Ecosystem Classification (AEC)](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/maps/mnrf::aquatic-ecosystem-classification-aec-for-ontario/about) together with [Flowing Waters Information System (FWIS)](https://www.comap.ca/fwis/) to develop predictive models of fish and benthic invertebrate communities across Ontario.

## Workflow

The data required for running models is too large to store on github, but can be downloaded from scripts included in this project.

Scripts in the R folder are numbered in the order they should be run. 

## Contribute

Fork the directory and copy locally. Feel free to send pull requests to merge changes into this main branch.
